### AWS CLOUD SOLUTION FOR 2 COMPANY WEBSITES USING A REVERSE PROXY TECHNOLOGY

- Let us Get Started
You have been doing great work so far – implementing different Web Solutions and getting hands on experience with many great DevOps tools. In previous projects you used basic Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings from AWS such as EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) as rented Virtual Machines and EBS (Elastic Block Store), you have also learned how to configure Key pairs and basic Security Groups.

- NOTE: The next few projects will be implemented manually. Before you begin to automate infrastructure in the cloud, it is very important that you can build the solution manually. Otherwise, programming your automation may become frustrating very quickly.

- You will build a secure infrastructure inside AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network for a fictitious company (Choose an interesting name for it) that uses WordPress CMS for its main business website, and a Tooling Website (https://github.com/<your-name>/tooling) for their DevOps team. As part of the company’s desire for improved security and performance, a decision has been made to use a reverse proxy technology from NGINX to achieve this.

- Cost, Security, and Scalability are the major requirements for this project. Hence, implementing the architecture designed below, ensure that infrastructure for both websites, WordPress and Tooling, is resilient to Web Server’s failures, can accomodate to increased traffic and, at the same time, has reasonable cost.
